                  The "web" is a collection of "pages" or documents on different
                  computers all over the world and all linked together. 
                  These documents
                  are usually written in a special way so other computers know how 
                  to display them properly. We use computer programs called 
                  "web browsers" to interpret these documents. When we (the "user") 
                  go to a website (e.g. udacity.com) our browser sends an "HTTP 
                  request" for the
                  computer on the other end (called a "server") to send us the 
                  document at that address. Our computer is called the "client" in 
                  this model.

                  Documents on the Web are written in HTML for other computers to read. 
                  An HTML document is regular text (for the humans) with funny marks 
                  interspersed (for the computer). These marks tell the computer how 
                  the text should look. Browsers take HTML documents and translate them 
                  into human-pleasing text using the "markup". Later we'll learn how 
                  "CSS" can take HTML and make the page look even more fancy for us 
                  (the user) to read.

                Markup - Tags, Elements, and <i>Attributes? Oh My!</i>

              <div class="note-text">
                <p>
                  HTML is made up of Elements which contain tags. Tags don't show up on 
                  the page but instead are read by the web browser to know how the text 
                  should be shown. Elements include the text content as well as other 
                  things like attributes which modify tags. Here's an example of an 
                  element: &lt;em&gt;this text is italic&lt;/em&gt;. In this case 
                  &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is the tag. A more complex element would be:
                  <a href="https://www.udacity.com" class='link'>&lt;a
                  href="https://www.udacity.com"&gt; click me! &lt;/a&gt; </a>. 
                  Can you guess what that does? In this case 
                  <em>href="https://www.udacity.com"</em> is an attribute.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tags usually have a beginning and end but not all. Tags that don't
                  need an ending tag (&lt;/em&gt; is the end) are called "void" tags. A 
                  good example of a void tag would be &lt;br&gt; which tells the 
                  browser to display the next text on a new line.

                  Elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Block elements 
                  have a virtual box around the content. HTML documents are lots of
                  boxes as we'll find out more.

                  Websites contain HTML, CSS, and Javascript files. HTML provide
                  structure and content, CSS provide style and defines how that
                  content looks, and Javascript provide interactive functions.

                <p>
                  HTML is written in a nested style with elements inside of
                  container elements. This resembles the structure of a webpage:
                  a bunch of boxes inside of boxes inside of other boxes. The HTML
                  code is indented to make the nested structure easier to read and
                  identify which boxes are inside of others.

                  Two websites can have the exact same HTML but look completely
                  different using CSS to change font, color, size, or more. 
                  CSS which has it's own language and syntax works with HTML 
                  to specify the style of the page.

                  DOM or "Document Object Model" is the name we give to the tree
                  of HTML code: the DOM Tree. Browsers take HTML documents and
                  parse them into a DOM.

                  HTML only makes boxes. CSS can change the look of these boxes
                  into circles by adding a border-radius property. Nevertheless
                  the box remains and what looks like a circle is still contained
                  in the box by rounding the edges of the border box.

                  Using special text editors helps programmers by automatically

                  letting you know when you missed putting a semicolon at the end.

                Three Ways of adding Style
              </div>
              <div class="note-text">
                <p> 
                  The first and best way to add CSS to HTML is with a separate
                  CSS style sheet. This way you can stay organized. Second,
                  one can add CSS code into the &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML
                  document. Third is adding CSS inline with each element. 
                  The third way should be avoided. It causes lots of repetition
                  and muddies the HTML document making it longer, more cluttered,
                  and just harder to read for humans.

              <div class="note-text">
                <p>
                  The "Cascading" part of CSS relates to the tree-like structure
                  (DOM) of HTML. Each element within an element inherits the CSS
                  style of it's parent element. More specific rules, meaning those
                  assigned to the most inner element will apply to that element
                  only if they replace the inherited rules.
                </p>

              </div>
              <div class="note-text">
                <p>
                  Defining rules for HTML elements, CSS uses the element tag
                  or the class assigned to the element. The second way is best
                  as it is more versatile and can single out groups of elements
                  or single elements. The difference is between defining a rule
                  for &lt;div&gt; or defining a rule for the div with class 
                  "title." The first will affect all div elements and the second
                  will only affect divs with the class specified "title."
